**Regenerate:** `cd control-center` → `npx playwright install chromium` (once) → `npm run screenshots:design-review`.

## Summary

The shell (header, tabs, market switcher, skip link, **Refresh** + build stamp) matches the brief’s **instrument-like** direction. **Deal status** is first-class: **badge** + **filter** + search includes status labels. Token usage stays centralized in `index.css` / `tailwind.config.js`.

**Ops:** GitHub Actions builds the control center and uploads the **`control-center-dist`** artifact. **Zo** options are documented in **`docs/ZO.md`**.

## Must Fix

_(none)_ — Re-run the screenshot script after major UI changes.

## Should Fix

1. **Table width**: `min-w-[800px]` may clip on small laptops — horizontal scroll + footer copy.
2. **`CardDescription` in breakdown**: Spot-check long addresses vs miles chip on narrow viewports.

## Could Improve

1. **URL query params** for `market` + `tab` (see `TASKS.md` deferred).
2. **Reduced motion** for expandable row (`prefers-reduced-motion` + `scrollIntoView`).

## What Works Well

- **Badge status variants** surface policy outcomes without reading flags only.
- **Clear filters** resets **both** search and status.
- **Expandable row** keeps table → detail context without a new route.
- **Contribution sandbox** copy stays honest (“not underwriting”).
